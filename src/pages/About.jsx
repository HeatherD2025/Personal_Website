                     <p>Hi, I’m a fullstack developer with a background in design, operations, and hospitality—and a lifelong curiosity about science, technology, and how things work.
                      After 12+ years leading teams and coordinating events, I made the leap into web development through an immersive Fullstack Academy bootcamp. 
                      I’m now focused on building creative, user-first applications with responsive design across all known dimensions.

                      <ul>
                        <li>Graduate of Fullstack Academy's immersive web development program (JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL)</li>
                        <li>Background in event operations, team leadership, and client-focused communication</li>
                        <li>Passionate about science, technology, and turning complex ideas into intuitive interfaces</li>
                        <li>Driven to design responsive, accessible web experiences that work everywhere</li>
                        <li>Collaborative mindset with a creative eye and strategic approach</li>
                      </ul>
                      Whether you’re building tools for Earth or beyond, I’d love to be part of your next mission. Let’s create something extraordinary—together.
