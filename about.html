  <p>I attended college at Oakland University studying art. As an avid drawer, I was drawn to other forms of expression and the potential to find a career path that utilized my creative talents. Although I graduated with a specilization in photography, I was deeply interested in advancing my painting. Since my time in school I have dedicated much of my free time to create large expressive pieces with the eventual hope to exhibit my work in the future.</p>

  <div></div>
  <p>I have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to travel to various countries over the last decade. Experiencing the art, foods, and general way of life elsewhere has helped me to appreciate the diversity and uniqueness of our world. I hope to continue to see new countries if the chance arises.</p>
